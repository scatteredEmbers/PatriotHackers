# PatriotHackers
# Our game is a parody of Cookie Clicker, themed around Patriot Hacks itself.
# In Cookie Clicker, there are upgrades the player can buy with "clicks" in order to automate the clicking process. 
# The more of one upgrade they buy, the higher the price is for that specific upgrade. Our "cookie" is the Patriot 
# Hacks logo, and our upgrades are the gold-tier sponsors that spoke at the opening event. We repurposed the Patriot 
# Hacks logo itself from their website, but created unique sprites that encompassed each sponsor by hand using pixilart.com.
